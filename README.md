# Smart-Contract-Policy-Claim
The added functionality is as follows:

The processClaim function is used to process a claim for a policy. It takes the policy ID as an input.
It first verifies that the policy ID is valid and that the caller is the owner of the policy.
It also checks if the claim has already been processed for the policy.
After performing the necessary claim processing logic (e.g., transferring the claim amount to the policy owner), the policy is marked as claimed by setting policy.isClaimed to true.
The ClaimProcessed event is emitted after the claim has been successfully processed, providing the policy ID.
You can customize the claim processing logic inside the processClaim function according to your specific requirements. For example, you might include verification steps, validation of claim details, calculations, or external calls to payment systems.
